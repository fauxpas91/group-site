        <h3>What is freeCodeCamp?</h3>
        <p>FreeCodeCamp is a nonprofit organisation founded by Quincy Larson in October 2014. His goal was to assist people learning web development while helping other nonprofit organisations with their web programming requirements.</p>
        <p>The student starts with basic html, css and JavaScript/jQuery tutorials and practice. The student then applies these fundamentals to some basic web design projects including the students' own Portfolio website, which is then used later to display their upcoming projects.</p>
        <p>The student moves on through the Algorithm Scripting section beginner, intermediate and advanced interspaced with beginner, intermediate and advanced Front-end Web Development Projects.</p>
        <p>After the completion of ten projects the student gains a Front-end Web Development Certificate.</p>
        <p>Further sections in the course cover the topics of Data Visualisation, Back-End and Full-Stack Web Development each successful completion receiving further certification.</p>
        <p>The technologies covered by the ciriculum are HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, Sass, React.js, Node.js, Express.js MongoDB and Git.</p>

        <h1>Site development roles</h1>
        <h3>About the development of this site</h3>
        <p>Any Reading freeCodeCamp member is invited to make changes to this site and it desperately needs some changes; it's appalling! Look at how garish it looks. Now youv'e visited sites galor during your web related activities and I'm sure some have really impressed you. What was it about those sites that made them look so good? Do you think you could move this site a bit closer to perfection?</p>
        <p>The main focus of this site is to give freeCodeCampers in the Reading group a chance to become familiar with git version control and Github as a means of collabarating on a project. So it doesn't really matter if you make mistakes, this is a safe place you can learn the git workflow. So please, just have a go; make mistakes, learn from them and evolve!</p>
        <p>But, of course, let's not tread on each others toes! So, we need a bit of organisation and I would like to suggest the following if and when you get involved: </p>
        <ul class="dont-step-on-each-others-toes">
          <li>Please don't change the content of this Site development roles page except to register your details against a role.</li>
          <li>Choose one of the roles that is not taken and put your name against an empty role ie. modify the html on this page to achieve this.</li>
          <li>Your role includes the html, css and javascript relating to that part of the site. This way you get a chance to practice three skills. Not all parts will require you to use javascript, it really is up to you.</li>
          <li>If you have finished making changes to your part of the site, let's say you might spend a couple of days or weeks improving a feature, then you don't want to do anymore. Please then take your details off the roles page, this will allow someone else to have a go.</li>
        </ul>
